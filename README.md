<h1>coupling and cohesion: </h1>
<p>Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.</p> 
<p>Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules.</p>

<h1><a href = "https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles" target="_blank"> SOLID Principles: </a></h1>

<p><b>Single Responsibility :</b> class should only have one responsibility</p>
<p><b>Open/Closed :</b> classes should be open for extension but closed for modification</p>
<p><b>Liskov Substitution :</b> if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program</p>
<p><b>Interface Segregation :</b>  larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.</p>
<p><b>Dependency Inversion :</b> The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.</p>





core java
default values in interface, overriding rules, constructor flow with arguments
hashCode and equals contract - leading to ( collections, sorting, indexof , etc ) 
comparable and comparator


spring
difference between object and beans - leading to ( lifecylce of beans, aop, 


threads communication - leading to ( leading to microservices, restapi )

what design patterns have you used and why ?
eg : singleton - why and how? 




what is tdd - leading to junit

disadvantages of microservices

sample code to write sortining with removing duplication using java 8
