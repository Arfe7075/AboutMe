<h1>This project contains my knowledge to write good code. This will always be work in progress</h1>

<h1>Coupling and Cohesion: </h1>
<p>Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.</p> 
<p>Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules.</p>

[SOLID Principles][1], [Java 8].

  

core java
default values in interface, overriding rules, constructor flow with arguments
hashCode and equals contract - leading to ( collections, sorting, indexof , etc ) 
comparable and comparator


spring
difference between object and beans - leading to ( lifecylce of beans, aop, 


threads communication - leading to ( leading to microservices, restapi )

what design patterns have you used and why ?
eg : singleton - why and how? 




what is tdd - leading to junit

disadvantages of microservices

sample code to write sortining with removing duplication using java 8
